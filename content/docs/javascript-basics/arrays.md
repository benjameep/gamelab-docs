*(Selecting items in arrays)*

An array is a list that stores multiple values in one place.

### Classroom Cubbies Example
["Pencil", "Marker", "Crayon"]

- Each cubby has a number called an index
- JavaScript starts at 0: 0 → Pencil, 1 → Marker, 2 → Crayon

## Getting an Item
let artSupplies = ["Pencil", "Marker", "Crayon"];
console.log(artSupplies[1]); // "Marker"

Arrays are great for:
- Game levels
- Player names
- Inventory items
- High scores

## Mini-Quiz
1. What index number is the first item in an array?
2. If pets = ["cat", "dog", "fish"], what is pets[2]?
